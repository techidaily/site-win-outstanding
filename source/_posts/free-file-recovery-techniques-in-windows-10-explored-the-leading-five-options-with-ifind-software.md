## ****Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

****How can I recover lost files on Windows 10?**

Recovering lost files on Windows 10 is an easy process. Follow these simple steps:

* Press the Windows key on your computer. Then enter and select Windows File Recovery.
* In the Command Prompt window, enter a command like this: winfr source-drive: destination-drive: \[mode\] \[/switches\]
* Regular and extensive are two basic modes for recovering files.
* Once you’ve selected the drive and entered the prompt, make sure the source and destination drives are different.
* Now, click on Y, and the recovery process will begin.

****Where can I find permanently deleted files in Windows 10?**

Files you deleted from the Recycle Bin using the Shift + Delete shortcut to delete files are marked as deleted by Windows, which removes all pointers to them. That’s why these files become invisible to users. Space used by those files is also marked as free space. So technically, these files are still available on your computer until Windows overwrites them with new data.

****How do I recover deleted files in Windows 10 without software?**

You can recover deleted files in Windows 10 without downloading or installing third-party software. You can do this by restoring files from the recycle bin:

* Enter the recycle bin by clicking the recycle bin icon on your desktop.
* Deleted files will appear here if you haven’t been here before and clicked the Delete key. Select the desired files.
* You can also drag desired files from the recycle bin into whatever folder you want.

If you are looking for a quality software solution, we highly recommend iFinD Data Recovery Software.

****Is it possible to recover permanently deleted files on Windows 10?**

Yes, it is possible to recover permanently deleted files from Windows 10\. However, it depends on whether you have not deleted those files from the recycle bin. These files are usually recoverable.
