## New Features Unveiled: EmEditor v24.3.0 Update Brings AI Integration & Enhanced Regex Tools - The Ultimate Text Editor

Today, we are excited to announce the release of [EmEditor v24.3.0](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/).

In [Version 24.0](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/), we introduced AI macros to EmEditor. With this new version (v24.3), we’ve taken it a step further by integrating AI functionality using the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/index/openai-api/) directly into EmEditor. This allows you to interact with AI right from within the editor. The simplest way to do this is through the new **Chat with AI** bar. By default, this bar appears when you select **Chat with AI** from the **View** menu. You can enter your prompt here and press Enter to get a response from the AI. For multi-line prompts, use Shift+Enter to add a line break, or you can create your prompt in the editor, copy it, and paste it into the **Chat with AI** bar. You can also drag and drop your prompt. To copy the AI’s response, right-click and select **Copy Message**.

Introduced the Chat with AI custom bar where you can type prompts to interact with OpenAI.

You can define frequently used prompts on the **AI Prompts** page in the **Customize** dialog. By default, prompts like “Send as is,” “Proofread,” and “Rewrite” are pre-defined. Prompts can include the entire document or selected text. For example, you can use the following placeholders:

```

$(DocText) Entire document
$(SelText) Selection
$(SelOrDoc) Selection or entire document

```

Using these, you can create prompts like:

```

Translate into French:
$(SelOrDoc)

```

In this example, if text is selected, it will be translated into French; otherwise, the entire document will be translated.

You can select the defined prompts from the **AI** submenu under the **Tools** menu, and they can also be accessed easily from the AI toolbar. If the AI toolbar is not visible, select **AI** from the **Toolbars** submenu in the **View** menu.

If you want to slightly modify a prompt before using it, right-click the prompt you want to use as a template from the menu or toolbar, and select **New Prompt**. This allows you to ask questions based on the selected prompt with modifications.

Introduced a New Prompt dialog box.

When defining prompts, you can also specify **Output**, **Max tokens**, and **Temperature** in addition to the message. For example, selecting **Create New Document** for **Output** will generate the AI’s response as a new document. If you are proofreading a document, selecting **Split and Compare** will display the document before and after proofreading side by side. Selecting **Image** will display the image specified in the prompt within EmEditor as a web browser. Adjusting the **Max tokens** can limit the number of words in the AI’s response. For example, if the **Max tokens** is set to 10, the response will be shortened to a few words. The **Temperature** setting controls randomness; a higher value results in more creative responses, while a lower value yields more consistent and accurate responses. Additionally, setting **Save to Chat with AI** will output the interaction with the AI to the **Chat with AI** bar, allowing you to monitor and save the conversation.

Added AI Prompts page to the Customize dialog box.

If you need common instructions for AI prompts, you can write them in the **System role message for AI prompts** section on the **AI Options** page in the **Customize** dialog. For example, writing “Do not use Markdown syntax” will prevent the AI from using Markdown syntax in its responses.

Renamed the AI page in the Customize dialog box to AI Options.

Additionally, based on customer feedback, you can now specify file names using regular expressions as well as wildcards in the **File Types** section of the **Find in Files** dialog. To use regular expressions, click the **\>** button to the right of the **File Types** dropdown in the **Find in Files** dialog and select **Regular Expression**. For example,

```

Data[0-9]{1,3}\.txt

```

will target only file names from `Data0.txt` to `Data999.txt` for searching.

Added Wildcard and Regular Expression to the File Types context menu in the Find/Replace in Files dialog box.

Since the previous version, an internet connection has been required for product registration, but some customers may not have access to the internet. Therefore, in this version, we have made it possible to register the product offline using the new **/ol** command line option. For customers who wish to do so, we will send an offline license file via email. Please refer to [Offline Registration](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/) for more details.

We hope you enjoy using EmEditor, whether you choose the **Professional** or **Free** version. Please [contact us](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/) or [write in our forums](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/) if you have any questions, feature requests, or suggestions.

Thank you for using EmEditor!
