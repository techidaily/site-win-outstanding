## What is Windows Task Manager and Processes?

As its name suggests, the Windows Task Manager is an essential component of the operating system that allows users to view every process running on their system and the overall performance of their system. It lets you end the frozen processes and evaluate how much system resources are free.

Processes are the part of the operating system that performs actions like launching an application, connecting to the network, opening settings, etc. Basically, everything you see or performs on the computer is a process. 

There are some times when some processes might cause errors and disturbances rather than aiding the users. Such processes are malicious and are caused by malware programs. The malicious process can sneakily remain in the background, use system resources, and performs malicious tasks such as spying, stealing data, using computing power for crypto mining, and more.

To catch the malicious process and malware behind it, we can use the Windows Task Manager.

## How to stay protected from Malware?

From bombarding annoying ads to stealing valuable data to lock your files, malware programs can perform various dubious tasks to make our life miserable. It is better to keep devices protected from them instead of dealing with them after the infiltration.
